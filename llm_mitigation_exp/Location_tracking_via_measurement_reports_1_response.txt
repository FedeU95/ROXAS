Summary: The suspicious trace exhibits several anomalous features, including an unusual NAS-EMM group ID, an uncommon Detach Request, an irregular TMSIs flag, an abnormal EIA5 value, and an excessive NAS-EMM EEA4 value. These indicators suggest a potential rogue base station attack, where the attacker is attempting to impersonate a legitimate user or perform unauthorized actions.

Actionable Mitigation Checklist:
1. Isolate the affected user equipment (UE) from the network by blocking its IP address or MAC address at the edge of the network.
2. Increase the RRC connection re-establishment timer for the affected UE to prevent it from quickly reconnecting to the network.
3. Implement a rule in the network's intrusion detection system (IDS) to flag any further activity with the same NAS-EMM group ID (8) and TMSI (10).
4. Monitor the number of detach requests from the affected UE and set an alert if the rate exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., more than 5 detach requests per hour).
5. Investigate the NAS-EMM EEA4 value (106) to determine if it corresponds to any known attack patterns or vulnerabilities. If so, update the network's security policies to protect against these threats.
6. Analyze the NAS-EMM EIA5 value (18) and TMSI flag (10) to determine if they are associated with any known attacker identities or tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). If so, update the network's threat intelligence database accordingly.
7. Review the NAS-EMM cause value (3) to determine if it corresponds to any known error or attack conditions. If so, update the network's error handling and incident response procedures to address these issues.
8. Investigate the nested field values (5, 7) to determine if they are associated with any known attack patterns or vulnerabilities. If so, update the network's security policies to protect against these threats.
9. Monitor the NAS-EMM common element ID size (27) to determine if it is unusually large or small. If so, investigate further to determine if it is indicative of an attack.
10. Collaborate with other network operators and cybersecurity organizations to share information about the detected rogue base station and any associated attack patterns or TTPs. This will help improve the overall security posture of the 5G network.
