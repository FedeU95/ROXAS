Summary: The suspicious trace exhibits several anomalous features, including an unusual NAS-EMM group ID, an uncommon Detach Request, an irregular TMSIs flag, an abnormal EIA5 value, and an excessive NAS-EMM EEA4 value. These indicators suggest a potential rogue base station attack, where the attacker is attempting to impersonate a legitimate user or perform unauthorized actions.

Actionable Mitigation Checklist:
1. Isolate the affected user equipment (UE) from the network by blocking its IP address or MAC address at the edge of the network.
2. Increase the RRC connection re-establishment timer for the affected UE to slow down potential attack traffic.
3. Implement a rule in the network's Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to flag any further occurrences of the NAS-EMM group ID (8), Detach Request (4), TMSIs flag (10), EIA5 value (18), and EEA4 value (106).
4. Monitor the number of NAS-EMM EEA4 messages for the affected UE and set an alert if the count exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 10 messages per minute).
5. Investigate the NAS-EMM EEA4 messages to identify any unusual patterns or payloads that may indicate the attacker's intentions.
6. Analyze the NAS-EMM common element ID size (27) to determine if it corresponds to any known attack vectors or malicious payloads.
7. If necessary, update the network's NAS/RRC and core/RAN configuration to further secure the network against rogue base station attacks. This may include implementing stronger authentication mechanisms, limiting the number of re-authentication attempts, and monitoring the NAS-EMM cause value (3) for any unusual reasons for detach.
8. Collaborate with other network operators to share information about the detected rogue base station and any potential countermeasures.
9. Continuously monitor the network for any further signs of the rogue base station or similar attacks.
