Summary: The suspicious trace exhibits several anomalous features, including an unusual NAS-EMM group ID, an uncommon Detach Request, an irregular TMSIs flag, an abnormal EIA5 value, and an excessive NAS-EMM EEA4 value. These indicators suggest a potential rogue base station attack, where the attacker is attempting to impersonate a legitimate user or perform unauthorized actions.

Actionable Mitigation Checklist:
1. Isolate the affected user equipment (UE) from the network by blocking its IP address or MAC address at the edge of the network.
2. Increase the RRC connection re-establishment timer for the affected UE to slow down potential attack traffic.
3. Implement a rule in the network's Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to flag any further occurrences of the NAS-EMM group ID (8), Detach Request (4), TMSIs flag (10), EIA5 value (18), and EEA4 value (106).
4. Monitor the number of NAS-EMM EEA7 messages for the affected UE and set an alert if the count exceeds a predefined threshold.
5. Investigate the NAS-EMM common element ID size (27) to determine if it is associated with any known attack patterns or malicious activities.
6. If possible, perform a deeper analysis of the UE's behavior, such as tracking its movement and identifying any unusual patterns.
7. Consult with the network vendor or security experts to determine if there are any known vulnerabilities related to the observed anomalies and apply appropriate patches or configurations.
8. Regularly update the network's security policies and configurations to protect against emerging threats.
9. Implement a user education program to ensure that users are aware of the risks associated with unauthorized access points and the importance of using secure connections.
10. Continuously monitor the network for any further signs of the rogue base station and take appropriate action as needed.
